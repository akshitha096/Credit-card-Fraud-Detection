# codsoft-Task-5-Credit-card-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. With the increasing number of online transactions, detecting and preventing fraud is crucial for financial institutions.

 # Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of labeled transaction records. The project employs various machine learning algorithms to achieve high accuracy in detecting fraud while minimizing false positives.
